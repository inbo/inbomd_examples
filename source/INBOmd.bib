  Abstract                 = {Understanding and predicting the dynamics of organisms is a central objective in ecology and conservation biology, and modelling provides a solution to tackling this problem. However, the complex nature of ecological systems means that for a thorough understanding of ecological dynamics at hierarchical scales, a set of modeling approaches need to be adopted. This review illustrates how modelling approaches can be used to understand the dynamics of organisms in applied ecological problems, focussing on mechanistic models at a local scale and statistical models at a broad scale. Mechanistic models incorporate ecological processes explicitly and thus are likely to be robust under novel conditions. Models based on behavioural decisions by individuals represent a typical example of the successful application of mechanistic models to applied problems. Considering the data-hungry nature of such mechanistic models, model complexity and parameterisation need to be explored further for a quick and widespread implementation of this model type. For broad-scale phenomena, statistical models play an important role in dealing with problems that are often inherent in data. Examples include models for quantifying population trends from long-term, large-scale data and those for comparative methods of extinction risk. Novel statistical approaches also allow mechanistic models to be parameterised using readily obtained data at a macro scale. In conclusion, the complementary use and improvement of multiple model types, the increased use of novel model parameterisation, the examination of model transferability and the achievement of wider biodiversity information availability are key challenges for the effective use of modelling in applied ecological problems.},

  Abstract                 = {An increasing number of legislations require reporting at regular intervals based on moni- toring [2]. Concomitantly, concerns about associated costs are becoming increasingly important. In some cases, part of the relevant information is collected by ongoing measurement schedules. This offers prospects to substantially reduce the sampling costs. However, as the existing programs were tailored for other purposes, their design is likely to be suboptimal for answering the new question. We used simulations to compare the performance, in terms of statistical power for trend detection and pre- cision of status estimates, of some sampling schedules. Results evidence that an ad hoc schedule, i.e. an agglomerate of several existing programs, requires a much larger sample size for trend detection. On the other hand, a continuous sampling schedule required the smallest sample size for trend de- tection, but performs weakest in terms of status estimates. Hence, trend detection and precise estimates of the status are, at least to some extent, two conflicting requirements. We derived formulas to evaluate the general conditions under which an ad hoc program is more cost-efficient than a newly designed monitoring schedule. These indicate that only under some very strict conditions an ad hoc schedule is likely to be cheaper. Essentially, hitchhiking with existing programs is only more cost-efficient when the analysis of the samples is cheaper than their collection. Hence, contrary to the intuition of policy makers and many others, answering new questions with data from existing monitoring programs is not necessarily the most cost-efficient way to obtain the relevant information.},

  Abstract                 = {The bulk of waterbird censuses are conducted by volunteers. Shifts in availability of volunteers leads to missing data. Missing data in waterbird censuses are commonly imputed using the method described by Underhill and Prys-Jones (1994). This method models the raw counts in terms of several covariates like site, month, year,...The missing data are imputed by the predictions of this model. Finally, the augmented dataset is analyzed. Since this method uses the predicted values to impute to missing data, the variances of the parameters of the ?nal analysis are likely to be underestimated. Two key factors play a role in this. Firstly, the apparent number of observation in the ?nal analysis is higher than the true number of observations. Secondly, predicted values are less variable than raw counts. Therefore the imputation adds data with much smaller variation. Furthermore, the method potentially biases the parameters estimates, depending on the starting values of the imputation. We compare this imputation method with a model-based multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987). A missing value is imputed by random number based on the distribution of the prediction for this value rather than the predicted value itself. The variance of the augmented dataset will increase depending on the uncertainty of the imputations and is most likely higher than when a complete dataset would have been available. Whereas imputing predicted values would result in a lower variance compared to a complete dataset. Next, we apply the same analysis to the augmented dataset. The results will o? course depend on the randomly imputed numbers. We accommodate this by repeating the imputation and analysis process several times. The param- eters of interest are averaged over the di?erent imputations. Their standard errors are based on the standard errors of the individual imputations and the variance among the parameter estimates.},

This article focuses on the feasibility of agri-environmental indicators that are aimed to be used for international comparisons. Indicators of two widely known international organizations, OECD and the Commission of European Communities, were evaluated from the viewpoint of national case study. There exist already plenty of methodology to describe agri-environmental development, which mean that future decision-makers will be better informed about the changes of agricultural systems. Data sets are, however, heterogeneous, which needs be carefully acknowledged by the users. Moreover, characteristic feature of agri-environmental indicators is, that they are producing information in a given problem structuring. Therefore, they are unable to recognize the specific properties of each case study. They are providing relevant statistics, but are still missing for the framework, which would open the meaning of numbers and show the relevance of notices within the particular case study.
