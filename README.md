This repository has some examples of documents generate with the [INBOmd style](https://www.github.com/inbo/INBOmd) for RMarkdown.
Please look at https://inbo.github.io/inbomd_examples for the rendered versions.
We wrote this documents with two goals in mind:
1) provide markdown example code for different kinds of element to use in a scientific document;
2) provide dummy output to examine to corporate style applied to the document.
Hence the actual content of the documents is rather nonsensical.
