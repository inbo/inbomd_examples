Please look at https://inbo.github.io/inbomd_examples for the rendered versions. We wrote this documents with two goals in mind: 1) provide markdown example code for different kinds of element to use in a scientific document; 2) provide dummy output to examine to corporate style applied to the document. Hence the actual content of the documents is rather nonsensical.<\/p>",
